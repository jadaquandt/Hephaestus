#### About Me: Growing up, I was never fully decided on what i wanted to do with my life. I was always quite undecided because everything I tried seemed to peak my interest to some degree at minimum. I worked at a Vet for about 6 years. So, naturally, i wanted to be a Vet. i loved working with animals, and i learned quite a bit from my time there. Then, always being an avid outdoorsman, I decided that ABAC would be the college for me, and i wanted to deal with Forrestry. For those who dont know what ABAC is, its pretty much the most country college the world has ever known. So country in fact, that they have a raccoon hunting club. I was of course a proud member, and for a short time a vice president of the club. Well, due to me coon hunting a little bit too much, my grades slipped, and my parents didnt believe i was taking school seriously, so tuition funding was stopped and back to Macon I went. Just a few credits shy of a degree.

#### So stuck at home, and in need for further education, i decided my best bet was to go to a technical college and get a degree in a certain trade. After careful consideration, i decided to tackle the adventure of Welding. Interesting enough, and would pay pretty well if i got a job in the field. So thats what i did for quite some time. But now, as i start to get a little bit older(33, but physical labor makes me feel like im about 55) Ive decided that all that hard work was okay when i was younger, but theres no way i can keep doing this until i retire. So i began to search for a better future, Thats when, My brother in law found DigitalCrafts. I watched him go from a basic job as a waiter, to a well paid, and job loving developer within a year. I was inspired. So i gathered the necessary resources, checked to see if i would be able to handle the material, and here I am. I couldnt be more excited for myself and my future. I'm very much looking forward to every part of this school, as well as what my future will hold if i strive, and apply myself.
