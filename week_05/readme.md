# Here is a quick overview on what to do:
* Remove all the `<div class="error"></div>` tags
* Rewrite the JavaScript to hightlight the `<input>` field with a red border    
    * You can use the method `setAttribute('class','my-class-name')` to do soe
* When the value is present, remove the border from the `<input>` tag

# Possible enhancements are
* Trying to validate the fields for more than only one input character
* Trying to validate the email for `@` symbol and presence of a `.`
* Trying to validate the phone number for input of numbers only
    * Allow for common phone number combinations
* Remove the red border when there is a value in the field and the input is losing focus
